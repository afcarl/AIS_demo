# AIS_demo
An basic artificial immune algorithm demo in the "Computational Intelligence" course of PKU.

AIS.py and some functions in func.py are written by myself, which implement the basic artificial immune algorithm.

GA.py and some functions in func.py are from http://blog.csdn.net/u010902721/article/details/23531359 (simon-zhao)
